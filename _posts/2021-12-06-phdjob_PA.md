This project will involve using low frequency liquid vibrations to develop a novel, low-cost, simple and scalable platform for manipulating bio-particles, such as cells and emulsions, in microfluidic channels. We will work with industrial experts to assess the feasibility of the technology for applications in bulk bio-particle processing and integration in healthcare diagnostic devices.
