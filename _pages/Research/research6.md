<!--**Optical Microcavites and Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics**-->

Recently, 3D photonic crystal structures with complete photonic bandgaps (PBGs) have been fabricated using direct laser writing, exploiting two-photon polymerization (2PP) based 3D lithography. The technique is ideal for fabricating non-layer based structures such as rod-connected diamond photonic crystal (RCD), and could allow selective writing of defects containing fluorescent  material at the antinodes of cavities. In this project, we study defect cavities in 3D photonic crystal, which can trap and store light in the smallest volumes allowable in dielectric materials, enhancing non-linearities and cavity QED effects. Here, we study inverse rod-connected diamond (RCD) crystals containing point defect cavities. Such a high-Q cavity with ultra-small mode volume could be used to demonstrate strong coupling at elevated temperatures, while coupled cavities of this type could form broad bandwidth, lossless, wavelength scale optical circuits in a fully 3D photonic crystal microchip. Additionally, these microchips could allow the development of ultrasensitive gas sensors, guiding and confining light in air or low refractive index material, and may also find applications in solar energy trapping and harvesting.
